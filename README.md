# Feather Takehome

### Timeline
Please send the completed project within 3 days. Let us know if you require more time.

### Version Control
Use git

### Language
JavaScript or TypeScript

### Objective
Build an interactive directory of github users, as well as an editable profile that demonstrates your ability to build a usable UI.

Note: We're not concerned with pixel-perfect, or design best practices – but it should be intuitive enough to use without instructions.

### Instructions

Using any version of [Github's API](https://developer.github.com/) make authenticated requests to fetch users and display them in a directory. The list of users could be the authenticated user's followers or following or something else entirely. The important part is that the authenticated user is included in the list of users.
Clicking on any user displays a modal with further user information.
When viewing the user that is logged in, the bio should be editable, and should update upon save.

##### Directory Requirements

* Display a list of usernames and their avatars
* A way to open a view for each user in the directory

##### User View Requirements

* Ability to view the selected user's username
* Ability to view the selected user's Avatar
* Ability to view the selected user's Bio
* Ability to edit Bio for the currently authenticated user
* Ability to save any changes
* Ability to close the user view

##### Constraints and Considerations

* Do not use Github API assistance such as [github-api](https://github.com/github-tools/github).
* Use libraries and modules you are familiar with freely, except for the above constraint.
* Leverage CSS and show off what you are capable of, animations and transitions are appreciated.
* Consider performance and scalability when interacting with GitHub and storing data.
* Create git commits as you proceed in development and reach stable checkpoints.
* Only add bonus' after you've met the requirements.

##### Bonus (Optional)
* Routing for pagination and modal
* Testing
* Profile
  * Repository count
  * Stars count
  * Following count
  * Gist count
  * Location
  * Email
  * Blog
  * Company
* GitHub's GraphQL API v4

### Submission

Create React App README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
